    "# NPU Programming for Low-Power Perception\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/next_gen_npu.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to set up and validate your NPU device, run vision pipelines using Ryzen AI libraries and integrate them into your ROS applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [XDNA Driver](1_xdna_driver.ipynb) - first we will learn about the XDNA driver, how to probe your device using `xrt-smi` and validate its functionality.\n",
    "2. [RyzenAI CVML libraries](2_ryzenai_cvml_library.ipynb) - you will learn about the RyzenAI computer vision libraries and the advantages of running vision models on the NPU.\n",
    "3. [Integration with ROS](3_cvml_ros.ipynb) - we will wrap our CVML applications from the earlier notebook into a ROS node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've completed this set of materials you will be familiar with what the NPU is and what it has to offer. You will have learned the necessary tools to probe the device and debug its state. And you will walk away with some prebuilt ROS-ready nodes to integrate into your own robotics projects.\n",
