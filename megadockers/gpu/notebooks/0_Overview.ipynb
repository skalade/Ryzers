    "# GPU-Accelerated Robot Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will cover the necessary tools you need to inspect your AMD GPU usage, you will learn how to run local Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with projects like Llama.cpp. Additionally we'll walk you through running robot policy models specifically tailored for robotics and we will show you how to integrate an AMD system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [AMD GPU Utilities](1_gpu_utilities.ipynb) - first we will walk through the driver stack and tools like `rocm-smi` and `amdgpu_top` to inspect GPU utilization.\n",
    "2. [Running LLMs](2_running_llms.ipynb) - you will learn how to run state-of-the-art LLMs/VLMs like gpt-oss and Gemma3 all locally on the Strix Halo.\n",
    "3. [Robot Policies](3_robot_policies.ipynb) - you will learn how to run a robot policy model like ACT (Action Chunking Transformer) in a simulated gym environment.\n",
    "4. [ROS Integration](4_vlm_ros_integration.ipynb) - finally we'll show you how to integrate one of these VLMs into your ROS application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've completed this set of notebooks you will be well equipped to run state-of-the-art AI applications on your local Strix Halo machine, debug using available ROCm utilities and integrate any AI model into your ROS projects.\n",
